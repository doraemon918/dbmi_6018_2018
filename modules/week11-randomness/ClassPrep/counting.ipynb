    "### Basic Product Principle of Counting\n",
    "Consider two independent events (that is, Event 1 does not influence Event 2) that occur simultaneously. Event 1 can result in $m$ possible outcomes. For each outcome of Event 1, Event 2 can result in $n$ possible outcomes. There are therefore $m\\cdot n$ possible outcomes of the two experiments taken together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof of Basic Principle of Counting\n",
    "The proof of the Basic Principle of Counting is obtained simply by enumerating the possible pairs of experiment outcomes. By listing each pair of outcomes as an array. We can see by inspection that there are $m$ rows and $n$ columns and thus $m\\cdot n$ outcomes.\n",

    "\n",

    "### General Product Principle of Counting\n",
    "Consider $r$ independent events that occur simultaneously. Event 1 has $n_1$ possible outcomes, Event 2 has $n_2$ possible outcomes, and so on. Then there are  $n_1\\cdot n_2\\cdot n_3 \\cdots n_r$ events taken together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### {Proof of General Principle of Counting}\n",
    "The proof of the general principle of counting proceeds in the same manner as the basic principle, but now we are writing out an $r$ dimensional area and what we are doing is essentially computing the volume of a hyper-cube???\n",

    "### Basic Sum Principle of Counting\n",
    "Consider two events ($E_1$ and $E_2$) that cannot occur together (that is if $E_1$ occurs then $E_2$ cannot occur and vice versa). $E_1$ can result in $n_1$ different values and $E_2$ can result in $n_2$ different values, the the total number of possible outcomes is $n_1+n_2$\n",

    "### General Sum Principle of Counting\n",
    "Consider $r$ events ($E_1, E_2, \\cdots, E_r$) only one of which can occur at a time. Each event results in $n_i$ possible outcomes, then there are $n_1+n_2+\\cdots+n_r$ possible outcomes.\n",

    "### Sum Principle of Counting: \n",
    "Let $n(A)$ denote the number of elements in a set $A$. Then if $A_1, A_2,\\cdots A_r$ denotes $r$ disjoint sets, then the sum principle of counting can be expressed as \n",

    "* We now have 13 possible choices. We continue doing this until we only have one student left, say Rich.\n",
    "* So the total number of ways we could have ordered the class is $15\\cdot 14\\cdot 13 \\cdots 1$\n",

    "### Permutations with indistinguishable objects\n",
    "\n",
    "What if what we are interested in is splitting the class into males and females? Say the class consists of 9 males and 6 females. Then when we say that we select Danielle we say that we are choosing a F which is indistinguishable from choosing Pooja, say. And selecting Kevin is indistinguishable from choosing Rich; they are both just M's.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know from the preceding discussion that there are $9!$ different ways to order the males and $6!$ ways of ordering the females. These orderings are accounted for in our $15!$ calculation, but they are in reality indistinguishable, so we need to divide our answer by the number of redundant arrangements.\n",

    "Consider some particular object (call it object 1).

Similarly there are $\\binom{n-1}{r}$ combinations of size $r$ that do not contain object 1 (you have to pick $r$ objects from the $n-1$ objects that are not object 1. Since a combination must either contain or not contain object 1 these two terms must add up to the total number of combinations $\\binom{n}{r}$. QED.\n",

    "We can prove the binomial theorem using a **proof by induction.** Since this is an important part of mathematics, we'll take the time to step through this here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way a proof by induction works is you show that it is true for some particular $n=m$. You assume it is true for some particular $n-1$ and then show that it is also true for $n$.
